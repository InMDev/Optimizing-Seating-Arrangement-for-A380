# Overview
This project aims to optimize the seating arrangement of an Airbus A380 aircraft for Singapore Airlines' flight from Singapore to London, maximizing profit while adhering to design constraints and passenger demand.

# Problem Statement
we consider the problem of finding the optimal seating arrangement for
the Airbus A380 aircraft for the SQ322 flight path from Singapore Changi Airport in
Singapore to Heathrow Airport in London. Methods such as combinatorial greedy
fill, linear programming, integer programming, and integer programming with regularization were considered and solved using Python. A mixture of seat classes using
regularization as a soft constraint for seating partitions was found to yield the best
balance of well-placed seat classes and high revenue following simulated ticket buying
trials.
